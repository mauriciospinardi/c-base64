# C Base64 Encoder/Decoder

A very popular way to encode binary data is [Base64](wikipedia.org/wiki/Base64).
Therefore, in this repository you will find code for a C Base64 Encoder/Decoder
PEM/MIME line ending compliant.  

The code of this project is actually a mirror for [John Schember](github.com/user-none)
work.  
His code was almost untouched, but he original version can be found
[here]([https://nachtimwald.com/2017/11/18/base64-encode-and-decode-in-c/).
Naming convention and other coding aspects also remain unaltered.
